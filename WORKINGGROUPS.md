### How to form a new working group

1. [Join CASA](./MEMBERS.md#join-casa) if you're not already a member.
2. Create a description that explains the goal of your working group and related CAIP(s).
3. Submit a Pull Request to the CASA repository adding your working group.
4. Propose your working group at the next editorial WG or in-person event. If approved, your PR will be merged, and your working group meeting schedule will be added to the CASA calendar.
5. Recruit participants for your working group.
