## **Purpose**

The CASA is a autonomous alliance dedicated to write standard for blockchain protocol that are not specific to a single chain. It aims to have collaborators from all the crypto-space. The initiative come from few crypto community members that self-organize with the objective of having unified and efficient process that include the whole ecosystem. It aim to make the crypto more seamless and more interoperable between protocols, software and companies.

The CASA have the only goal to organize working group, be a place where all proposals are gathered and to publish final CAIPs and implementation proposals that could be adopted by the community. 

## **Structure**

The CASA has three levels of participant structure:

| Role                            | Description            |
| :-------------                  | :-----------              |
| Members            | All participants. Expected to participate in working groups. |
| Working Groups            | Collections of members tackling specific areas of interest, such as Ceramic governance or identity. |
| Maintainers                    | Members that run CASA meetings (not working group meetings) and ensure overall integrity of process. |

## **Meetings**

### **CASA Meetings**

The entire CASA gathers every 6 weeks for a meeting (attendance is optional). In this meeting, members:

- Share progress from existing working groups
- Propose the creation of new working groups
- Evaluation of the CAIPs

> Since CASA meetings are primarily built around sharing progress from working groups, at least 1 member from each active working group is expected to attend.

### **Working Group Meetings**

CASA members self-organize into topic-based working groups. Individual working groups decide their own meeting schedule, and communicate in their own designated communication channel. We expect working groups to meet frequently enough to share out at the next CASA meeting (currently every 6 weeks). Use the CASA meetings notes template to take good meeting notes to keep the rest of the CASA aligned.
