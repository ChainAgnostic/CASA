CASA is structured into three groups: 
1. Members (anyone committed to the mission and participating even passively)
2. Working Groups (participating more actively on a set topic)
3. Board (managing the organization) 

More concretely:

| Role           | Description                                                                                     |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Members        | All participants who contribute in any form, including github review. Expected to participate in one or more topical working groups. |
| Working Groups | Topical clusters of CAIPs, namespaces, and other repositories/workstreams. These change over time according to activity |
| Editorial Working Group | A subset of membership including the authors of accepted CAIPs committed to ongoing review and maintenance of the CAIPs and namespaces |
| Board | Governing/steering body of core members guiding the organization and making high-level strategic decisions about its execution of its mission |
| Janitor (Board Member) | Drive and oversee operations, budget, editorial processes, and events |
| Treasurer (Board Member) | Oversight and reporting on any external grants or donations |
